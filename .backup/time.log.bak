Major Difficulties
------------------
- Understanding the structure of the program was difficult -- how child
processes interact with parent processes, when to fork/dup, etc
- Didn't understand how exactly to implement CD/DIRS -- saw that your code
was executing a child process, and mimicked that, but it took a while to see
that this child process for builtin commands is communicating errors, while
the parent is actually executing the command.

- Didn't understand when/how to reap zombies
